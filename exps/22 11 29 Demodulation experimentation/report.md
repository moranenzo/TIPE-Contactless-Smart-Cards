<h1>Experiment Report: Testing the Amplitude Demodulation Device</h1>

<h2>Objective of the Experiment</h2>
<p>
  The objective of this experiment is to test an amplitude demodulation device, allowing us to retrieve the modulating signal carried by the message transmitted by the card. Today, we used the demodulation device on a sample circuit.
</p>

<h2>Steps of the Experiment</h2>

<h3>1. Building the Circuit</h3>
<p>
    We assembled a basic circuit to test the demodulation device, using a multiplier to modulate the signal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Parameters Used:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Carrier signal: 70 kHz, 10 Vpp</li>
    <li>Modulation signal: 300 Hz, 1 Vpp</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Constructing the Demodulation Device</h3>
<p>
    We chose to use an amplitude demodulation device for this experiment, as recommended by our tutor.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Components Used:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Multiplier</li>
    <li>Diode</li>
    <li>Capacitor: Cd = 0.22 µF</li>
    <li>Resistor: Rd = 10 kΩ</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Observations</h3>
<p>
    We plotted the voltage recovered after the demodulator, as well as the input voltage to the demodulator, over time. It can be observed that the former accurately corresponds to the demodulation of the latter, with negligible time delay.
</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
    The demodulation system accurately demodulated the voltage. We successfully retrieved the modulating signal, which indicates that this demodulator system is well-suited to our needs and can be used for future experiments.
