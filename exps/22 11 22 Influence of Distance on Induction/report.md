<h1>Experiment Report: Influence of Distance on the Induction Effect</h1>

<h2>Objective of the Experiment</h2>
<p>
  The objective of this experiment was to investigate the influence of the distance between two coils (one within the card and the other within the reader) on the card-reader interaction. In real life, as long as an RFID card is not in close proximity to the reader, no message is transmitted. Therefore, the distance between the coils must be a crucial factor in the induction phenomenon.
</p>

<h2>Steps of the Experiment</h2>

<h3>1. Building a Circuit to Study the Phenomenon</h3>
<p>
    We used two simple circuits for this experiment. The first circuit consists of a function generator (GBF) and a coil (without an additional resistor due to the GBF's internal resistance), which is connected to a simple coil where we measured the voltage.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Parameters Used:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Inductance of coils: L1 = L2 = 36 mH</li>
  <li>Function Generator (GBF): Amplitude = 5 V peak-to-peak, Frequency = 1 kHz</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Data Collection</h3>
<p>
    To assess the impact of the distance between the coils, we plotted the amplitude of the voltage measured in the card as a function of distance. For each distance between the two coils, we recorded the amplitude of the voltage around the isolated coil.
</p>

<h3>3. Observations</h3>
<p>
    By plotting all the data collected and analyzing the curves, we observed the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Distance has a significant influence on the amplitude of the voltage.</li>
  <li>At distances of 2 to 3 cm, the amplitude is too low to transmit complex signals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
  The results indicate a strong influence of distance on voltage amplitude. At distances of 2 to 3 cm, the amplitude is insufficient for transmitting complex signals. However, this limitation is not problematic, as cards are typically positioned close to the reader
