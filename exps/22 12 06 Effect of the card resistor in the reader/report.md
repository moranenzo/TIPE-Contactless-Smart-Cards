<h1>Experiment Report: Testing the Amplitude Demodulation Device</h1>

<h2>Objective of the Experiment</h2>
<p>
  The objective of this experiment was to test an amplitude demodulation device, enabling us to retrieve the modulating signal carried by the message transmitted by the card. For this purpose, we used the demodulation device on a sample circuit.
</p>

<h2>Steps of the Experiment</h2>

<h3>1. Building the Circuit</h3>
<p>
    We assembled a basic circuit to test the demodulation device, using a multiplier to modulate the signal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Parameters Used:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Carrier signal: 70 kHz, 10 Vpp</li>
    <li>Modulation signal: 300 Hz, 1 Vpp</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Constructing the Demodulation Device</h3>
<p>
    We opted for an amplitude demodulation device for this experiment, following the recommendation of our tutor.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Components Used:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Multiplier</li>
    <li>Diode</li>
    <li>Capacitor: Cd = 0.22 µF</li>
    <li>Resistor: Rd = 10 kΩ</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Observations</h3>
<p>
    We plotted the voltage recovered after the demodulator, as well as the input voltage to the demodulator, over time. We observed that the recovered signal accurately matches the demodulation of the input signal, with negligible time delay.
</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>
    The demodulation system functioned effectively. We successfully retrieved the modulating signal, confirming that this setup is well-suited to our needs and can be applied in future experiments.
